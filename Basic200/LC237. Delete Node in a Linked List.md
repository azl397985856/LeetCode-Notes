## LC 237. Delete Node in a Linked List

https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-linked-list/ --
Write a function to delete a node in a singly-linked list. You will not be given access to the head of the list, instead you will be given access to the node to be deleted directly.

It is guaranteed that the node to be deleted is not a tail node in the list.

### 思路

让现在的 node 的值变成下一个节点的值  
然后删除下一个节点

### 代码 JavaScript

```JavaScript
var deleteNode = function(node) {
    node.val = node.next.val
    let next = node.next.next
    node.next = next;
};

```
