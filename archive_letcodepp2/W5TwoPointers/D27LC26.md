### 思路

two pointers

1. Have two pointers
2. Check if the values at pointer positions equal to each other  
   2.1 if they are equal, fastPointer moves 1;  
   2.2 if they are not equal, slowPointer moves forward and copies array[fastPointer]'s value
3. ending condition: when fastPointer has interated all elements in the input
4. return the length of modified array. Because slowpointer is the index of the array, offset with +1.

### 代码

```JavaScript
var removeDuplicates = function(nums) {

 let slowPointer = 0;
 let fastPointer = 1;

 while (fastPointer < nums.length){
   if (nums[fastPointer] === nums[slowPointer]){
     fastPointer++;
   }else {
     slowPointer++;

     nums[slowPointer] = nums[fastPointer]
   }
 }
 return slowPointer+1;  //slowPointer is the index, +1 is to offset the index to length.
};

```

### 复杂度分析

时间复杂度：O(N)
空间复杂度：O(1)
