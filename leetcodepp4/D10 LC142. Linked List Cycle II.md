## LC 142. Linked List Cycle II

https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/linked-list-cycle-ii/

Given a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return null.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.

Notice that you should not modify the linked list.

Example 1:

Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: tail connects to node index 1
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.
Example 2:

Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: tail connects to node index 0
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.
Example 3:

Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: no cycle
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.

### 思路 Two Pointers: fast & slow pointers

![LC142](https://github.com/lilyzhaoyilu/LeetCode-Notes/blob/master/assets/Floyd'sCircleFinding.jpg)

#### 代码 JavaScript

```JavaScript
var detectCycle = function(head) {
  let fast = head, slow = head;

  do{
    //check if there is a loop
    if(!fast || !fast.next) return null;
    fast = fast.next.next
    slow = slow.next
  }while(fast != slow)


  fast = head;

  //locate the entrance of the loop
  while(fast != slow){
    fast = fast.next
    slow = slow.next
  }

  return fast;
};

```

#### 复杂度分析

时间复杂度：O(N) </br>
空间复杂度：O(1)

### 思路 Hashtable

Construct a hashtable (new Set() in JavaScript)  
Iterate through the linked list
if there is a repeated node, then it is then entrace of the loop  
if the node === null, then there is no loop

#### 代码 JavaScript

```JavaScript
var detectCycle = function(head) {
  const memo = new Set()

  while(head){
    if(memo.has(head)){
      return head
    }else{
      memo.add(head)
    }
    head = head.next
  }

  return null;
};

```

时间复杂度：O(N) Iterate through the linkedlist</br>
空间复杂度：O(N) Hashtable to store the linkedlist
