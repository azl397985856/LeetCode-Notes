## LC 768. Max Chunks To Make Sorted II

https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/max-chunks-to-make-sorted-ii/  
This question is the same as "Max Chunks to Make Sorted" except the integers of the given array are not necessarily distinct, the input array could be up to length 2000, and the elements could be up to 10\*\*8.

Given an array arr of integers (not necessarily distinct), we split the array into some number of "chunks" (partitions), and individually sort each chunk.  After concatenating them, the result equals the sorted array.

What is the most number of chunks we could have made?

Example 1:

Input: arr = [5,4,3,2,1]
Output: 1
Explanation:
Splitting into two or more chunks will not return the required result.
For example, splitting into [5, 4], [3, 2, 1] will result in [4, 5, 1, 2, 3], which isn't sorted.
Example 2:

Input: arr = [2,1,3,4,4]
Output: 4
Explanation:
We can split into two chunks, such as [2, 1], [3, 4, 4].
However, splitting into [2, 1], [3], [4], [4] is the highest number of chunks possible.
Note:

arr will have length in range [1, 2000].
arr[i] will be an integer in range [0, 10**8].

### 思路 单调递增栈/Monotonic Queue

want: concatenating chunks == to the sorted array
equavilantly: seeking a data structure represnets a strict increasing order -> monotonic queue

#### 代码 JavaScript

```JavaScript

var maxChunksToSorted = function(arr) {
  let queue = [];

  for(let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){

    if(queue.length == 0 || (queue[queue.length - 1] <= arr[i])){
      queue.push(arr[i])
    }else{
      //the size of the queue reprensets the size of partition

      let temp = queue.pop()
      while(queue[queue.length - 1] > arr[i]){
        queue.pop()
      }

      queue.push(temp)
    }

  }
  return queue.length
};

```

空间复杂度：O(N)

### 思路 滑动窗口/Sliding Window

The sum of each sorted chunk equals to the sum of the original chunk regardless of the sort order.

#### 代码 JavaScript

```JavaScript

var maxChunksToSorted = function(arr) {
  let sum1 = 0, sum2 = 0;
  let count = 0

  sorted = arr.slice().sort((a,b) => a - b)

  for(let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
    sum1 += arr[i]
    sum2 += sorted[i]

    if(sum1 === sum2) count++
  }

  return count;
};

```

#### 复杂度分析

时间复杂度：O(N logN) -> N for iterating through the array, logN for sort </br>
空间复杂度：O(N)
